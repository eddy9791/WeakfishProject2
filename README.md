# WeakfishProject
MS263 class project

### Data Description:
Weakfish were collected in tidal salt marash creeks of the Deleware Bay, and analyzed for lipid class content, and stable isotopes.

### Project Goals:
1. Assess how juvenile weakfish store their lipids at different life stages
2. Assess the stable isotopes of the juvenile weakfish collected at different locations within the Deleware Bay

### Preliminary Analysis
I created three plots in the preliminary analysis:
1. The length vs weight curve of the juvenile weakfish
2. The length of the weakfish and the percent of triglycerides (TAG) of the total lipid content
3. The length of the weakfish and the percent of triglycerides (TAG) of the total lipid content based on location
